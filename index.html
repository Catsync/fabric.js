  <p class="primary"><strong>Fabric.js</strong> is a framework that makes it easy to work with HTML5 canvas element.</p>
  <p class="primary">It is an <strong>interactive object model</strong> on top of canvas element.</p>
  <p class="primary">It is also an <strong>SVG-to-canvas</strong> (and <strong>canvas-to-SVG</strong>) parser.</p>

  <p>Using Fabric.js, you can create and populate objects on canvas; objects like simple geometrical shapes — <strong>rectangles, circles, ellipses, polygons</strong>, or more complex shapes consisting of hundreds or thousands of simple paths.</p>

  <p>You can then <strong>scale, move, and rotate</strong> these objects with the mouse; modify their properties — color, transparency, z-index, etc. You can also manipulate these objects altogether — grouping them with a simple mouse selection.</p>

  <p>You can add <strong>text on canvas</strong> and dynamically manipulate its size, alignment, fontfamily and other properties. You can apply <strong>filters to images</strong>, making them grayscale or removing background. You can <strong>serialize the entire canvas</strong> into a JSON string — saving it locally or on a server — then completely restore it at any time. You can also export canvas data <strong>back into SVG</strong> at any time.</p>
